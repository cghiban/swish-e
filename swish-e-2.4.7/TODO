A rough to-do list. 

Feel free to add/update items here (and feel freer to write code so that
we can remove them).

NOTE: This is not the same as the 3.0 planning document. See the pod/ dir for that.

=====================================================================


** Test USE_BTREE and the ARRAY code for both speed and accuracy.

** Go over config.h

Seems like the intent was to create more user-visible config options, rather than "hiding" them in config.h.

** Configfile also for "read/search" operations


** enhance search (regex, wildmatch, exact match)
[ from the comments: ]
- New config directive SearchMode [exact|partial|wildmatch|regexpr]
- New cmdline option (to be defined)

allow to specifiy how search will be done:
- exakt string (no wildchars) (100% length and partial)
- wildcard search (?, *): e.g.: wor?d*to*tch
- regexpr. serach: e.g.: [a-z][0-9]*abc$


** Code cleanup...

sisyphus would be proud...

** Dealing with "and" "or: "not" "*" in searches

seems like part of your quest for a better query parser? 
read any non-sleep-inducing Bison lately?


** Altavista like search

This is hard to track. Looks like rasc put it in there, 
but now it looks like it has been removed. Any ideas? It's marked as 95% complete.



** licensing issues
